Trade-Statistics
Backend (Node.js and Express):

Set up a Node.js project and install Express using npm.
Create routes to handle API requests from the frontend.
Make a request to the external API (e.g., Alpha Vantage) to get the trade statistics for a specific stock on a particular day.
Parse the API response and send the required data to the frontend.


Frontend (React):

Set up a React project using Create React App or your preferred method.
Create components for input fields (stock symbol and date), a button to trigger the API request, and a section to display the trade statistics.
Use the Fetch API or axios to make a request to the backend API when the user clicks the button.
Receive the trade statistics data from the backend and display it on the frontend.
